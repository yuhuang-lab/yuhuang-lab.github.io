About me
=====
Toby Jia-Jun Li is an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.nd.edu/) at the [University of Notre Dame](https://www.nd.edu/) where he directs the SaNDwich Lab. Toby received a Ph.D. degree in [Human-Computer Interaction](https://hcii.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/), where he was advised by [Brad A. Myers](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~bam/). Toby also worked closely with [Tom M. Mitchell](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tom/). Prior to Ph.D., Toby received his Bachelor's degree in [Computer Science](https://www.cs.umn.edu/) from the [University of Minnesota](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/) where he worked with [Brent Hecht](https://brenthecht.com/) as a member of [GroupLens Research](https://grouplens.org/).

Toby works at the intersection of **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)**, **End-User Software Engineering**, **Machine Learning (ML)**, and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** applications, where he uses human-centered methods to design, build, and study interactive systems to empower individuals to create, configure, and extend AI-powered computing systems. His recent work seeks to address the **societal challenges in the future of work** through a bottom-up **human-AI collaborative** approach that helps individual workers automate and augment their tasks with AI systems.

Toby publishes at premier academic venues across HCI, NLP, and systems (e.g., CHI, UIST, CSCW, ACL, MobiSys, VL/HCC), **including 4 award-winning papers**: a best paper honorable mention paper at CHI '21, a best paper at UIST '20, a best paper at IS-EUD '17, and a best paper honorable mention paper at CHI '17. Toby has collaborated with Microsoft Research, IBM Research, Verizon, and J.P. Morgan. His work has been supported by Yahoo! through the [InMind project](http://www.cmu.edu/homepage/computing/2014/winter/project-inmind.shtml), by [J.P. Morgan](https://www.jpmorgan.com/global/technology/artificial-intelligence/awards), and by [NSF](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1814472&HistoricalAwards=false).
