<span style="color:red">I am co-organizing the first workshop on
Human-Centered AI for Software Engineering (HumanAISE, co-located with FSE/ISSTA
2025). Please join us and share your work with us!</span> 
Workshop Website: [https://humanai4se.github.io/](https://humanai4se.github.io/). Paper submission deadline: Feb 15, 2025. 


About me
=====
My first name "Yu" can be confused as "You" sometimes. So people 
around me also call me "Huang Yu" together :)

I am an assistant professor of Computer Science at Vanderbilt
University. I am also affiliated with the [Institute for Software
Integrated Systems](https://www.isis.vanderbilt.edu/), [the Frist Austism Center](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/autismandinnovation/), [the Vanderbilt Lab for Immersive AI Translation (VALIANT)](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/valiant/) and [the LIVE Learning Innovation Incubator](https://lab.vanderbilt.edu/live-lab/) at Vanderbilt.

I lead the research of the **MIND Lab** -- the **M**ixed **IN**telligence
**D**evelopment for programming lab (ask us how long it took us to find a
name for our lab finally!). 
Our research focuses on understanding and combining human cognition and
machine
intelligence to improve the effectiveness and efficiency in
the software development process. 
Occasionaly I also work on other fun projects with my students.

Our research has been supported by NSF, GitHub and Vanderbilt Immersion. 
Our work has been mainly published in top venues in Software Engineering (e.g.,
ICSE, FSE, TSE, TOSEM), also in Systems, HCI and Psychology (e.g., UbiComp, ASPLOS, CSCW, JMIR). 
We have received three ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished Paper
Awards (ICSE 2019, FSE 2023, ICSE 2024). 

I received my PhD in Computer Science at the University of Michigan
in 2021. My advisor was [Prof. Westley Weimer](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~weimerw). I received my MS in Computer Engineering at University of Virginia in
2015 and my BS in Aerospace Engineering from Harbin Institute of
Technology in China in 2011.


Research 
======
My group focuses on **human factors and human-centered AI for software engineering**, including
human cognition, AI for software engineering, sustainability for open source software, and computer
science education. 
Our work aims to bridge the divide between human cognition and automated models for programming.
Our work spans software,
hardware, AI, medical imaging (fMRI and fNIRS), eye tracking, and mobile sensing, collaborating with researchers from Security, Education, Psychology and Neuroscience.
We also work on social aspects in the software engineering community.
	
All (but not limited to) the following questions are of interest in my group and I look
forward to hearing crazy ideas from students!

- How do programming experts become experts?
- How do programmers comprehend and write code? How do they really think in programming tasks?
- How and why do programmers make mistakes in programming?
- How can we learn from human cognition and expertise to improve automated models in
  programming?
<!-- - How can we defend our system in the existence of cognitive biases? -->
- How can we improve participation and diversity in programming?
