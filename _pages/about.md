Toby Jia-Jun Li is a final year Ph.D. candidate in the [Human-Computer Interaction Institute](https://hcii.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University, advised by [Brad A. Myers](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~bam/). He also works closely with [Tom M. Mitchell](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tom/). Toby works at the intersection of HCI, AI, and end-user software engineering, where he uses human-centered methods to design, build, and study interactive systems to empower end-users and novice programmers to create, configure, and extend AI-powered computing systems. 

Toby's thesis focuses on a multi-modal approach that combines conversational natural language instructions and programming by demonstration techniques to enable intelligent agents to interactively learn new tasks and concepts from end users.

Toby has authored more than 15 publications in premier academic venues across HCI, NLP, and systems (e.g., CHI, UIST, CSCW, ACL, MobiSys, VL/HCC), including a best paper at UIST '20, a best paper at IS-EUD '17, and a best paper honorable mention paper at CHI '17. Toby’s work is supported by a Yahoo! Fellowship through the [InMind project](http://www.cmu.edu/homepage/computing/2014/winter/project-inmind.shtml), by [J.P. Morgan](https://www.jpmorgan.com/global/technology/artificial-intelligence/awards), and by [NSF](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1814472&HistoricalAwards=false).
