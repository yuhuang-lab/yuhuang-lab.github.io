Advising and Research Opportunities
=====
I would love to meet with students to discuss their research
         interests and career plans. Unfortunately, faculty's schedule
         is not always open (in fact, most of the time we are busy with who
         knows what is going on). So please check my calendar below for
         potential meeting slots: I really prefer putting such meetings
         on Monday, Tuesday and Thursday so that I can focus on other
         work on Wednesday and Friday. Please only consider
         Wednesday/Friday if
         that is your only choice.
        
My calendar can be viewed <a href="https://outlook.office365.com/owa/calendar/4995ea572e414aa692d698811d83cdf7@Vanderbilt.Edu/c9ef7f81ed8b41438435d8cdd70dce1a2478064644761699759/calendar.html" target="_blank">here</a>.

If you want to meet with me, please find one or multiple
open slots that work for you on my
calendar and email me the slots, meeting purposes and
whether it is in person or zoom. If I didn't reply your email within a
week, please feel free to send another email to remind me.

 <h2>Research Opportunities </h2>
 For undergraduate and master students who are interested in research,
        you are very welcome to schedule a meeting with me. Please send
        me your CV when you schedule the meeting.

 For potential PhD students, please send me an email first
        with your CV and research interests. Then over emails we will
        talk about next steps (i.e., if we should schedule a meeting). 
        
 Please read the <em>FAQ</em> below
          before contacting me.
         
<!-- <h3> FAQ </h3> -->
 <ul>
    <li><strong>Can I do undergraduate research for
    credits?</strong> </li>
    <p> Yes. You can register CS2860, CS3860, CS3861 and CS3862
    (3862 is for team project only) for
    research credits. You can also use undergraduate research to
    fill
    your Immersion requirement.</p>

    <li><strong>Can I directly register for research credits (e.g.,
    CS2860/3860/33861)
    with you before talking to you?</strong> </li>
    <p> No. The system will first require my approval anyway. But more
    importantly, I only take undergraduate researchers that are
    motivated and willing to commit to our project plans: to evaluate if it is a good fit,
    you need to schedule a meeting with me first.</p>

    <li><strong>When can I start doing undergraduate research
    with you?</strong> </li>
    <p> In theory, it is never too late/early to do research as long
    as you are interested. In practice, I suggest students to
    consider it after (or at least when you have started) taking
    CS2201 Data Structures. Also, I suggest you consider it no
    later than the begining of the second semester of your
    junior year especially if you want to apply for graduate
    school. </p>

     <li><strong>I am an undergrad in CS and I want to get a
     software development job after graduation. Do I have to do
     undergrad
     research to get that type of job?</strong> </li>
    <p> No. You don't have to do research to get an industry SDE
    job. But yes, the experience you gained from your research
    project can speak for your capabilities. I personally
    don't think undergrad research is more appealing to
    recruiters than
    having an industry internship in this context.  </p>

    
    <li><strong>I am currenly an undergrad student in another
    country. Can I do remote research with you?</strong> </li>
    <p>Our lab is open to remote collaboration. Please email me
    first.</p>

    <li><strong>Do you have PhD openings?</strong> </li>
    <p>In general, it depends on my grant situation. But it is
    case by case. So please email me first. </p>

     <li><strong>How should I call you?</strong> </li>
    <p>My students usually call me "Dr. Huang" or "Prof. Huang".
    This is not because I care about the title that much, but
    more about "this person's first name (Yu sounds like You) is a disaster in
    conversation". In general, you can call me "Yu, HuangYu, Dr.
    Huang, Prof. Huang" or whatever as long
    as I can tell you are trying to talk to me.</p>



 </ul>


<h2>Undergraduate Advising </h2>
<p>For my undergraduate advisees (i.e., I am assigned as your
academic advisor), I schedule office hours for all of you every 
semester before the course registration for
the next semester starts. Please try your
best to go to the OH if you want to discuss your course
plans. If you cannot make that OH or have other questions
during the semester, please feel free to email me and/or schedule a meeting
as needed.</p>  

<p>I have been collecting and updating common FAQs for my undergrad advisees  as below. Please read
them first when you have a question (because you can
probably find an answer really fast):</p>



 <ul>
       <li><strong> Where can I find the general guidance for my
       course requirement in CS?</strong> </li>
    <p>Here you can find all the documents for CS courses (under
    Advising  Resources -> Computer Science): <a target="_blank"
 href="https://engineering.vanderbilt.edu/academic-services">Course
 Requirement.</a> </p>
    <p>Detailed descriptions for the CS graduation requirements
    can be found here: <a target="_blank"
 href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/catalogs/kuali/undergraduate-23-24.php#/content/64766d03b47341001cb4f0a6">Curriculum 
 Requirements.</a> And please remember the Degree Audit is
 the most useful tool for you to check if you are on track for
 graduation.</p>

 <li><strong> How do I know what courses I still need to graduate? Can
 Course X be used to staisfy the requirement of Y for my
 graduation/major/minor?</strong> </li>
 <p>Based on our experience, the best way to check your own graduation
 plan (regarding courses) is to check the Degree Audit in YES. You are
 highly recommended to use the What If feature in Degree Audit to test
 if a course would be counted for a requirement.</p>




  <li><strong> Where can I find the undergraduate academic
  catalog for CS?</strong> </li>
    <p>Here you can find all the courses offered by CS including
    research credits (just look for the corresponding academic
    year -> Undergraduate -> School of Engineering -> Computer
    Science -> COURSES OFFERED: CS): <a target="_blank"
 href="https://registrar.vanderbilt.edu/catalogs/">Catalogs.</a> </p>


 <li><strong> Where can I find the general information for all
 advising-related questions?</strong> </li>
 <p>Here you can find most of information for undegrad advising: <a target="_blank"
 href="https://engineering.vanderbilt.edu/departments/computer-science/undergraduate-program/#faqs">Undergraduate
 Advising - CS FAQs</a>. </p>

 <li><strong> Can I study aboard? Can I transfer the credits
 from my abroad program?</strong> </li>
 <p> This is a good starting point: <a target="_blank"
 href="https://engineering.vanderbilt.edu/academics/undergraduate/study-abroad/">Study
 Abroad</a>. </p>

 <li><strong> I am an international student and I need summer CPT for my
 internship. How should I start the process?</strong> </li>
 <p> Getting CPT approval requires a series of steps completed by the
 student applicant: <a target="_blank"
 href="https://engineering.vanderbilt.edu/academics/undergraduate/professional-development/curricular-practical-training/">CPT
 for International Students</a>.It also includes the registration for ES
 3884 with me as your academic advisor (you need to email OAS to enroll in this course, it is advisable to CC me in the email). For your offer letter, please make sure it follows the dates
specified in the CPT instructions each academic year (the dates are very
important and non-negotiable). Upon the completion of your internship,
you need to submit a report for 3884 before the deadline (the deadline
is usually after your internship end date but before the summer course
grading deadline. We can discuss the deadline for the report per case.)</p>






<li><strong>Where can I find the form to (1) apply for a
major/minor (2) audit a class (3) waive prerequisite and 
(4) basically anything about undergrad education?</strong> </li>
<p>All the forms are listed here: <a target="_blank"
    href="https://engineering.vanderbilt.edu/academic-services/AcademicAdvising/Forms.php">
    Forms for Students</a>.</p>

<li><strong> How can I enroll in CS2860/3860/3861/3862 in YES (after having a plan with the professor I intend to work with)? </strong> </li>
<p> Please refer to "HowTo's" in this Forms link: <a target="_blank" href="https://engineering.vanderbilt.edu/academics/undergraduate/academic-services/forms/">Engineering Forms</a>.</p>

<li><strong>As an undergrad student, can I take a grad course and how?</strong> </li>
<p>Yes. Here you can find the information about whether you are
eligilble, how to enroll in a graduate course, and the policy (under "UNDERGRADUATE ENROLLMENT IN GRADUATE COURSES"): <a target="_blank"
    href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/catalogs/kuali/undergraduate-23-24.php#/content/64766d03b47341001cb4f09f">
    School of Engineering Academic Regulations</a>. You can also use a
    graduate course as CS depth. However, if you do so, you cannot ALSO apply the
    credit to a Vanderbilt Accelerated masters, Vanderbilt graduate
    degree, nor can you transfer the course to another university
    graduate program (i.e., this credit is already "consumed").</p>


<li><strong> How can I view/calculate my major CS GPA in YES? </strong> </li>
<p> Open your Degree Audit, then "Bachelor of Science: Computer
Science" > "Computer Science Veirfy 2.0 GPA in CS Courses". Details
might be slightly different based on your home school.</p>

<li><strong> What are the requirements for getting a CS minor? </strong> </li>
<p> The information is listed in the end of the CS catalog (see "where
can I find the undergraduate academic catalog for CS?" above).</p>



 <li><strong> Can you help me change XYZ in YES? </strong> </li>
<p>Sadly I don't have any permission to edit anything in YES
associated with your audit. For such requests, you will need
to contact the Engineeging OAS via email: engineering-oas at vanderbilt.edu.</p>

 <li><strong> I really need to enroll in course CS XXXX but
 it is full. Can you add me to the course?</strong> </li>
<p>Sadly I don't have any permission to add a studnet to a
full class. If you really need this course (e.g., "I really
need to take this course this semester, otherwise I won't be
able to graduate on time."), please email the instructor and
me about your situation.</p>



</ul>
