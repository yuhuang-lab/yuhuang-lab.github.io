## Bible Study Group
When not teaching or doing research, I and my wife Julia lead a Mandarin-speaking campus ministry of <a href="https://mcccin.org/" target="_blank">Michiana Chinese Christian Church</a> for the communities of Notre Dame, IUSB, and other local campuses. We hold a weekly bible study group on Friday nights. Let me know if you are interested in joining us. We will provide rides and dinners. Students from all (or no) faith backgrounds are welcomed!

## Archive of My Faculty Job Market Materials
Below you can find my faculty application materials for the 2020-2021 job market. I have benefit a lot from the generosity of my friends and colleagues who shared their materials with me, which helped me tremendously in navigating this opaque process. I hope my material may also be useful for future faculty candidates.
