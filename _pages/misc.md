## Archive of My Faculty Job Market Materials
Below you can find my faculty application materials for the 2020-2021 job market. I have benefit a lot from the generosity of my friends and colleagues who shared their materials with me, which helped me tremendously in navigating this opaque process. I hope my material may also be useful for future faculty candidates.
