title: 'CMU: Designing Human-Centered Software'
collection: teaching
date: 2019-02-01
venue: 'DHCS is CMU’s main “introduction to HCI” course. This course introduces the skills and concepts of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) that enable computer scientists to design systems that effectively meet human needs. A concrete illustration of the practice of HCI, this course covers iterative design processes, interactive prototype construction, discount evaluation techniques, and the historical context of HCI. I TA’d this course with Prof. Chris Harrison in Spring 2019. My responsibilities included holding office hours, grading assignments, and help conducting project “bakeoffs”.'
