title: 'CMU: User-Centered Research and Evaluation'
collection: teaching
date: 2018-09-01
venue: 'As one of the core “flagship” courses for CMU’s Master in HCI program, this course introduces the skills and concepts of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) that enable computer scientists to design systems that effectively meet human needs. A concrete illustration of the practice of HCI, this course covers iterative design processes, interactive prototype construction, discount evaluation techniques, and the historical context of HCI. I TA’d this course with Profs. <a href="https://www.amyogan.com/">Amy Ogan</a>, <a href="https://raelin.me/">Raelin Musuraca</a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/christophermconnors">Chris Connors</a>. My responsibilities included holding weekly office hours, leading recitation sessions,  and designing assignments, projects, and exams.'
